Keyword frequency map of words in PHP
=====================================

Inspired by http://www.wordle.net/ and Daniel Barsotti

Job description is parsed and frequencies associated with the keywords. These frequency tables are used to create a visually attractive wordcloud that can be used to identify the keywords that must be included in resume.

Problem Definition
--
It's important for job applicants to know how to craft their resumes to catch the attention of recruiters. The use of specific keywords in your resumes increases the chance that a recruiter will notice your resume - both because many recruiters will search resumes by keywords, and because those keywords will pop out as they read it. In order to help our users, we want to figure out the important keywords or phrases to include in their resume.

Build an application that uses our jobs API to find trending keywords or phrases. You may use any programming language, and any algorithms you wish.
Our API is documented here: https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2
Specifically, look at the jobs endpoint.
